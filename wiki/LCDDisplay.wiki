#Hantronix HDM16216L-5 16x2 LCD Display

== Contrast Adjustment ==
The contrast for the Hantronix display is controlled by adjusting the current flow from the V,,L,, pin to ground. This can be done using a resistor to tie the pin to ground and limit the current flowing, or in our case using a transistor to adjust the flow of current.

Current characteristics for contrast adjustment (V,,L,, pin).
 * I,,L,, Max = 450 uA
 * I,,L,, Visible = 325 uA
